# Practical 10

## Estimates
My accuracy for completion time estimates was sometimes accurate and other times not so accurate. Sometimes activities
even took me twice as much time than what I expected. The activity that took me the longest was the project management
activity in practical 7 which took me 337 minutes (or 5 and a half hours). I suppose the reason some activities took
longer than others across all the practicals is because some days I was more tired than others and still had to finish
my work but at least I submitted all my practicals in on time.

## Code Reviews

What I learnt from being reviewed and reviewing is that everyone in the subject including me are all at different 
stages and levels in their coding ability. It was interesting giving feedback to people on something that I knew 
very well about for example instead of doing the same error checking in two places like someone I reviewed, I had 
already solved that issue by making a robust error checking function that I could easily reuse when I wanted. It was
also very helpful to receive quality feedback from other people which allowed me to further improve my coding skills. 
It was also interesting to see the different ways in which other people wrote their code.

## Practical Tasks
There's really not much I'd change as I felt as though the practical tasks have been very well-developed. One thing I
might consider though would be to add some more walkthrough activities as I enjoyed them and believe they were very
helpful.
